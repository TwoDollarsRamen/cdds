 == Submission Structure ==

| Project		| Directory				|
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hash Table		| ./hash/				|
| Linked List		| ./linkedlist/				|
| List Tests		| ./listtest/				|
| Binary Tree		| ./fromtemplate/CDDS_BinaryTree 	|
| IPC			| ./fromtemplate/CDDS_IPC_EntityDisplay	|
|			| ./fromtemplate/CDDS_IPC_EntityEditor	|

== Build Instructions ==

Release executables are in the `./bin` folder.

 - All of the projects in the `./fromtemplate/` directory must have their
configurations set to `x64`.
 - The Linked List project needs to have it's `res` folder placed in the
program's working directory, or next to the program when running externally
to the IDE.

== Observation of Use of Version Control ==
A screenshot of the repository commit history can be found in `./commit.png`.

The repository itself is at: https://github.com/TwoDollarsRamen/cdds

The use of version control went extremely smoothly for this assessment, partly
because I have prior experience using Git. One of the things that I like about
using version control is being able to clearly split up tasks by committing
work every time I finish writing a feature.

The user experience of Git and the Git CLI was flawless. I didn't have any
hiccoughs setting up a repository, everything couldn't have gone more
smoothly. The only thing that wasn't quite clear at first was how to
manage multiple accounts on one machine, it took a bit of trial and error
to get that set up and working properly, but I got there in the end.
