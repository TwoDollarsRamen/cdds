# Build Instructions

Release executables are in the `./bin` folder.

 - All of the projects in the `./fromtemplate/` directory must have their
architectures set to `x64`.
 - The Linked List project needs to have it's `res` folder placed in the
program's working directory. This is relevant when running outside of
the IDE.
